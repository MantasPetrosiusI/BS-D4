<!--DONE EXERCISES
1) Create a Jumbotron section with a quick explanation / image of the website.

Make it appear with a fade-in animation effect when the page loads.

2) Use a Bootstrap Card to contain every album in the favorite list you previously created.

Use the elements of a card bootstrap gives you, to display nicely the album information such as: album title, artist, year, etc..

4) Create a new section with an album tracklist inside a Bootstrap table. The row colors of the table must be alternated. There should be a column for the track order number, one for the title, one for the artist name and one for the track duration. (you can also add extra columns)

6) Add an “Add Track” button under the tracklist of the album.

It should have a nice shadow transition when it gets hovered (with the box-shadow property) to look as if the button was elevating itself up. (you can search for more effects and add more)
